    """<H1>Problem Definition</H1>
Crime data is often presented in a static, dense format, making it difficult for key stakeholders â€“ such as policymakers, law enforcement, and the public. Hence, the absence of a dynamic, user-friendly visualization tool that allows users to compare crime trends between metropolitan and regional areas, highlighting patterns and areas of concern in an actionable way. 

<H1>Goal</H1>
The primary goal of this project is to develop an easy-to-use, interactive website that visualizes crime data across both metropolitan and regional areas of Western Australia. 

<H1>Narrative</H1> 
This project focuses on creating an engaging narrative about how crime data visualization can empower stakeholders to take meaningful action to improve community safety. 

<H1>Target Audience</H1> 
The platform is designed to cater to a wide range of stakeholders, including Police officers and law enforcement agencies, Government agencies, Researchers and academics, Residents of Western Australia. 

<H1>Dataset Summary</H1> 
The project uses crime data from the Western Australia Police Force, covering the period from January 2007 to June 2024. 

<H1>Dataset Analysis Summary</H1>
Data exploration involved loading and transforming data from the WA Police Force Crime Time Series Dataset.<br> Key analysis techniques included: 
<ul>
<li>Bar Plots: To rank crime frequencies and district crime rates. </li>
<li>Scatter Plots:  To explore relationships between crime counts and district populations.</li> 
<li>Cluster Maps: To visualize crime distribution based on various dimensions. </li>
<li>Line Plots: To analyse trends in crime over time.</ li> 
</ul>

<H1>Hypothesis Development:</H1>
<ul>
<li>H1: High-population districts have high crime counts â€“ Not valid; <br>Although there is a trend of districts with high populations to have higher crime counts, the highest populated district does not have the most crime counts.</li>  
<li>H2: Regional districts have lower crime counts â€“ Not valid;<br> regional areas show higher crime rates per 100 residents.</li>
</ul>
<H1>Visualization Techniques:</H1>
<ul>
<li>Interactive Choropleth Map: Displays crime rates by district and allows users to interact for detailed insights.</li> 
<li>Bar and Line Plots: Enhanced with interactivity for user engagement and analysis of crime data over time.</li> 
</ul>
